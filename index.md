Hello! I’m El Commit, a full-stack web developer from Argentina.

I really enjoy to make websites and web apps that are easy and nice to use. I work with front-end (what you see) and also back-end (how everything works), so I can build the full solution from start to finish.

Usually I work with technologies like React, Node.js, and Python to make websites that look good and run smooth. I like to listen my clients carefully to understand exactly what they want and always try my best to deliver even better.

When I’m not working, I like walking around Buenos Aires, drinking mate, or meet other developers and learn new things.

Feel free to contact me—we can build something great together!
